    "setDescription": "The Basis Yield ETH Index from Galleon automates a perpetual basis trading strategy that returns a delta-neutral, levered high yield index to those that hold the token. Built using Setâ€™s integration with Perpetual Protocol on Optimism, BYE contains a fully hedged 2x ETH position, with equivalent spot exposure and short exposure via perps. Holders of BYE will earn a USDC-denominated yield when the funding rate is positive while removing exposure to the price volatility of the underlying asset.\n\nKey Features:\nAutomated Strategy: Management of underlying spot and perp positions are fully managed, token holders require no interaction.\nCompounding Yield: The yield BYE generates accrues to the token value over time and is compounded weekly.\nComposability: BYE can be integrated, issued, redeemed, and exchanged across DeFi due to being an ERC20 compliant token.\nEase of Access: Abstracts a sophisticated trading strategy into a single token, simply swap in and out of the strategy.\n\nFees:\nThere is a transparent 10% performance fee associated with this product - Galleon as an organisation only accrues profit whilst holders are generating positive yield.",
